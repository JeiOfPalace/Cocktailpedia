# MyCocktail

<p>This is a project developed at the University in a subject where we learned cross-platform application development. On this occasion, we were asked to develop a web application with the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>REST actions</li>
<li>User authentication with the NoSQL database Firebase</li>
<li>Provide more functionalities for registered users</li>
<li>Use Angular, Vue or React</li>
<li>Use Ionic SDK</li>
</ul>

<p>Within this app, any unregistered user can search a stack of cocktails for whether they're alcoholic or not, their category and instructions. On the other hand, the registered user can login / logout, save their favorite drinks in a list and manage it. In addition, you can also play a mini-game. The app is not intended for UX/UI design, as the main goal of the project was to learn the basics of cross-platform app development.</p>

<p>I hope you like it!</p>
